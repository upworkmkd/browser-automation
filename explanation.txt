## SETUP AND CONFIGURATION (1:30 - 3:00)

**[Show terminal/code editor]**

"First, let's look at the setup process. The tool is built with Node.js and uses Playwright for browser automation.

**Installation is straightforward:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Configuration is done through environment variables:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
QUORA_EMAIL=your_quora_email
QUORA_PASSWORD=your_quora_password
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_linkedin_email
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_linkedin_password
AUTO_CLOSE_BROWSER=false
DEBUG_CAPTCHA=true
```

The tool requires an OpenAI API key for two main functions:
1. AI-powered element detection - to intelligently find buttons, inputs, and interactive elements
2. CAPTCHA solving - using GPT-4 Vision to solve image challenges

**Key features of the setup:**
- Session persistence - login once, reuse sessions
- Flexible browser management - keep open for debugging or auto-close
- Debug modes for troubleshooting
- Environment-based configuration for security

The tool supports multiple platforms through a simple command-line interface. 
The tool uses an intuitive command-line interface

Let me show you how it works."


Let's start with a simple demonstration. I'll run the Quora question creation to show you the basic flow.

As you can see, the tool immediately starts:
1. Initializing the browser
2. Loading existing session if available
3. Checking login status
4. Proceeding with the requested action

Notice how it provides detailed, color-coded logging throughout the process - green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors. This makes it easy to track progress and debug issues."

"Now let's see the AI magic in action. Watch how the tool intelligently finds elements on the page.

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

See this response: 'This element has the text "Add question" and an aria label that also states "Add question". This clearly indicates that it is intended for creating a new question...'

This intelligent approach means the tool works even when websites update their designs or change their HTML structure. Traditional automation tools break when websites change - our AI adapts automatically.


"One of the most impressive features is the automatic CAPTCHA solving capability. Let me show you how it handles different types of CAPTCHAs.

**Real-World Benefits:**
- Saves hours of manual social media management
- Maintains consistent posting schedules
- Handles complex authentication challenges
- Adapts to website changes automatically
- Provides detailed logging and debugging information


Thank you for watching this demonstration. This tool represents the future of intelligent browser automation - where AI handles the complexity so you can focus on strategy and creativity.
